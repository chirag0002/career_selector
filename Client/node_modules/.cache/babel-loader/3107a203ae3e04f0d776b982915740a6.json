With so many options, including central universities, state universities, private \r\n                    universities and a myriad of institutes, choosing a college to attend becomes a major decision. One\r\n                    solution that students often adopt is to consider the college rankings and the marks they have scored,\r\n                    opting to enrol with the highest ranking institute possible with their marks.However, it’s your turn to\r\n                    be smarter, and set yourself apart from the crowd following the trend of ranking universities blindly.\r\n                    While admittedly, college rankings are a good way to judge the performance of a college, it should not \r\n                    be the only criteria.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Why You Should Not Rely on College Rankings Alone When Selecting a College</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The process of ranking a college is a mix of subjective and objective analysis of the concerned college.\r\n                    While some aspects such as pass-out percentage, placement rates, and student-teacher ratio have quantifiable\r\n                    numbers, the overall worth of a college involves much more, including the environment the college offers,\r\n                    how open it is to help students grow, and the dedication that is provided to the students.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    For example, the famous QS World University rankings identify top colleges based on 5 factors. Firstly, \r\n                    academic reputation accounts for 40 percent of the rating, citations per faculty for 20 percent,\r\n                    student-faculty ratio for 20 percent, employer reputation for 10 percent and ‘internationalisation’\r\n                    of faculty and students for 5 percent each.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Many rankings do not even release the criteria used for ranking, while others incorporate factors\r\n                    such as the number of Nobel laureates an institute has produced. In addition, the rankings are prone\r\n                    to fluctuation and are often influenced by superficial issues such as building infrastructure or library size.\r\n                    The most important point to remember is that your needs are your own, and not necessarily based on the\r\n                    same factors as the bodies posting the rankings. Having a higher number of PhD holding faculty will\r\n                    not automatically result in better teaching.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h3>Other Factors to Consider When Selecting a College</h3>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    So, if you are not to rely entirely on the college rankings, then what should be the criteria to select\r\n                    a college? Well, the simple answer is that there are multiple factors you should keep in mind to ensure\r\n                    you make the best choice for a college.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h5>1. Accreditation</h5>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    When selecting a college, it’s important that the college is recognized and accredited to offer the course\r\n                    you are interested in. This is especially important for private colleges and up-coming institutes which may\r\n                    not always have all the courses officially recognized.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h5></h5>\r\n                <h5></h5>\r\n                <h5>4.
