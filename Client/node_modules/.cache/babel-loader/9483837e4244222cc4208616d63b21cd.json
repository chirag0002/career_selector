Not just because everyone studies science\r\n                    subjects till class 10th at least, but also because this is a stream people can’t seem to stop talking about.\r\n\r\n                    <br /><br/><b> From statements like, “Go for the science stream so that you can become an Engineer or a Doctor” to even\r\n                    “You are good at academics, you would be thinking of opting science, I’m sure?”</b>\r\n\r\n                    <br /><b> Those of you who are preparing for the 10th standard board exams are most likely surrounded by questions like which stream to choose?</b>\r\n                    <br /><b> Whether to take a road less travelled or study subjects opted by many?</b>\r\n                    <br /><b> And what are the career prospects in different fields?</b>\r\n                    <br /><br/> Self-introspection is the key to unlock the box of your queries!  As you are aware, you can opt for \r\n                    either Science, Commerce or Arts stream after 10th standard. Before choosing a stream, you should conduct an in-depth \r\n                    analysis of your strengths and weaknesses and then select a stream that aligns with your interests and professional goals.\r\n                    While the Commerce and Arts stream subjects have their own advantages, methodologies, and career prospects, we, in this blog,\r\n                    will shed light on various Science stream subjects. But before that, let us try to understand the reasons for choosing this \r\n                    stream. \r\n\r\n                    While these notions hardly hold a candle to reality, chances are you would have some type of understanding about what the science\r\n                    stream entails.\r\n\r\n                    The Science stream, as I mentioned above, relates to the study of the physical and natural world through the study\r\n                    of pure sciences and their applications in the real world. From understanding how the laws of gravitation govern\r\n                    planetary motion to learning about the structure of the atom, you will uncover the many mysteries of the world around\r\n                    us.\r\n\r\n                    Thus, innate curiosity and keenness to explore, coupled with a logical thinking ability are essential to be successful\r\n                    in this stream.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p className=\"school_container2_subheading\">2. Science Stream Subjects after Class 10th :</p> \r\n                <p>The science stream is further divided into 2 branches, namely medical (PCB) and non-medical (PCM) science stream.\r\n                <br /> \r\n                The difference between the two lies in the choice of the third subject. While Physics and Chemistry are compulsory for both, the medical stream offers Biology as the 3rd compulsory subject, and the non-medical stream offers Mathematics. English is common to all streams and students can take up any optional subject to meet a total of 5 subjects.\r\n\r\n                Here is a detailed look into the compulsory subjects in the Science stream:\r\n                </p>   \r\n                <p className=\"school_container2_subheading_1\">\r\n                    I.

The most popular ones being,\r\n                    “Commerce is good for average students who cannot get into science” or “Commerce is only suitable for students from\r\n                    business families.”\r\n\r\n                    These are again a far cry from the truth. Commerce is a field that relates to the study of business, trade and finance.\r\n                    Commerce students study how goods and services are exchanged, how businesses operate, how financial transactions occur,\r\n                    how the economy of the country works, and more. The indispensability of commerce and its related careers to our day-to-day\r\n                    living makes it a lucrative field to explore, and one with a wide choice of career options too.\r\n\r\n                    While you may or may not choose to study Mathematics as part of Commerce, numbers form the base for this stream.\r\n                    A strong hold over calculations and fundamentals of maths, and the ability to deal with large amounts of data are\r\n                    critical elements of success in the commerce stream. \r\n\r\n                    Commerce as a teaching medium may be defined as the study of business and marketing activities such as the trade of goods and services \r\n                    from the manufacturer to the end client. Students might select this field if they have a genuine passion in these disciplines and a \r\n                    strong connection to the economy, business, and statistics.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p className=\"school_container2_subheading\">2.
