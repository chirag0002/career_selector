of colleges in India, and thousands upon thousands \r\n                    more internationally. With so many options, including central universities, state universities, private \r\n                    universities and a myriad of institutes, choosing a college to attend becomes a major decision. One\r\n                    solution that students often adopt is to consider the college rankings and the marks they have scored,\r\n                    opting to enrol with the highest ranking institute possible with their marks.However, it’s your turn to\r\n                    be smarter, and set yourself apart from the crowd following the trend of ranking universities blindly.\r\n                    While admittedly, college rankings are a good way to judge the performance of a college, it should not \r\n                    be the only criteria.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 className=\"college_des_subheading\">Why You Should Not Rely on College Rankings Alone When Selecting a College</h3>\r\n                <br />\r\n                <p>\r\n                    The process of ranking a college is a mix of subjective and objective analysis of the concerned college.\r\n                    While some aspects such as pass-out percentage, placement rates, and student-teacher ratio have quantifiable\r\n                    numbers, the overall worth of a college involves much more, including the environment the college offers,\r\n                    how open it is to help students grow, and the dedication that is provided to the students.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br />\r\n                <p>\r\n                    For example, the famous QS World University rankings identify top colleges based on 5 factors. Firstly, \r\n                    academic reputation accounts for 40 percent of the rating, citations per faculty for 20 percent,\r\n                    student-faculty ratio for 20 percent, employer reputation for 10 percent and ‘internationalisation’\r\n                    of faculty and students for 5 percent each.\r\n                </p> \r\n                <br />\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Many rankings do not even release the criteria used for ranking, while others incorporate factors\r\n                    such as the number of Nobel laureates an institute has produced. In addition, the rankings are prone\r\n                    to fluctuation and are often influenced by superficial issues such as building infrastructure or library size.\r\n                    The most important point to remember is that your needs are your own, and not necessarily based on the\r\n                    same factors as the bodies posting the rankings. Having a higher number of PhD holding faculty will\r\n                    not automatically result in better teaching.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br />\r\n                <h3 className=\"college_des_subheading\">Other Factors to Consider When Selecting a College</h3>\r\n                <br />\r\n                <p>\r\n                    So, if you are not to rely entirely on the college rankings, then what should be the criteria to select\r\n                    a college? Well, the simple answer is that there are multiple factors you should keep in mind to ensure\r\n                    you make the best choice for a college.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br />\r\n                1.

Not just because everyone studies science\r\n                    subjects till class 10th at least, but also because this is a stream people can’t seem to stop talking about.\r\n\r\n                    <br /><br/><b> From statements like, “Go for the science stream so that you can become an Engineer or a Doctor” to even\r\n                    “You are good at academics, you would be thinking of opting science, I’m sure?”</b>\r\n\r\n                    <br /><b> Those of you who are preparing for the 10th standard board exams are most likely surrounded by questions like which stream to choose?</b>\r\n                    <br /><b> Whether to take a road less travelled or study subjects opted by many?</b>\r\n                    <br /><b> And what are the career prospects in different fields?</b>\r\n                    <br /><br/> Self-introspection is the key to unlock the box of your queries!  As you are aware, you can opt for \r\n                    either Science, Commerce or Arts stream after 10th standard. Before choosing a stream, you should conduct an in-depth \r\n                    analysis of your strengths and weaknesses and then select a stream that aligns with your interests and professional goals.\r\n                    While the Commerce and Arts stream subjects have their own advantages, methodologies, and career prospects, we, in this blog,\r\n                    will shed light on various Science stream subjects. But before that, let us try to understand the reasons for choosing this \r\n                    stream. \r\n\r\n                    While these notions hardly hold a candle to reality, chances are you would have some type of understanding about what the science\r\n                    stream entails.\r\n\r\n                    The Science stream, as I mentioned above, relates to the study of the physical and natural world through the study\r\n                    of pure sciences and their applications in the real world. From understanding how the laws of gravitation govern\r\n                    planetary motion to learning about the structure of the atom, you will uncover the many mysteries of the world around\r\n                    us.\r\n\r\n                    Thus, innate curiosity and keenness to explore, coupled with a logical thinking ability are essential to be successful\r\n                    in this stream.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p className=\"school_container2_subheading\">2. Science Stream Subjects after Class 10th :</p> \r\n                <p>The science stream is further divided into 2 branches, namely medical (PCB) and non-medical (PCM) science stream.\r\n                <br /> \r\n                The difference between the two lies in the choice of the third subject.

English is common to all streams and students can take up any optional subject to meet a total of 5 subjects.\r\n\r\n                Here is a detailed look into the compulsory subjects in the Science stream:\r\n                </p>   \r\n                <p className=\"school_container2_subheading_1\">\r\n                    I.

What is Commerce :</p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Commerce is defined as the exchange of goods and services among individuals and business entities.\r\n                    In academics, Commerce is considered to be one of the most popular streams of education along with Science and Arts.\r\n                    Commerce deals with the various aspects of business, trade, accounting, financial information/transactions and merchandising.\r\n                    Commerce plays a significant role in the development of nations and its citizens by facilitating trade between nations or within\r\n                    the nation.\r\n\r\n                    The next in line, Commerce is not without its own associated myths. The most popular ones being,\r\n                    “Commerce is good for average students who cannot get into science” or “Commerce is only suitable for students from\r\n                    business families.”\r\n\r\n                    These are again a far cry from the truth.

The indispensability of commerce and its related careers to our day-to-day\r\n                    living makes it a lucrative field to explore, and one with a wide choice of career options too.\r\n\r\n                    While you may or may not choose to study Mathematics as part of Commerce, numbers form the base for this stream.\r\n                    A strong hold over calculations and fundamentals of maths, and the ability to deal with large amounts of data are\r\n                    critical elements of success in the commerce stream. \r\n\r\n                    Commerce as a teaching medium may be defined as the study of business and marketing activities such as the trade of goods and services \r\n                    from the manufacturer to the end client. Students might select this field if they have a genuine passion in these disciplines and a \r\n                    strong connection to the economy, business, and statistics.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p className=\"school_container2_subheading\">2.
