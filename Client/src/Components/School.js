                <p className="padding_bottom">
                    This is one stream that most of you would have a fair bit of idea about. Not just because everyone studies science
                    subjects till class 10th at least, but also because this is a stream people can’t seem to stop talking about.

                    <br /><br/><b> From statements like, “Go for the science stream so that you can become an Engineer or a Doctor” to even
                    “You are good at academics, you would be thinking of opting science, I’m sure?”</b>

                    <br /><b> Those of you who are preparing for the 10th standard board exams are most likely surrounded by questions like which stream to choose?</b>
                    <br /><b> Whether to take a road less travelled or study subjects opted by many?</b>
                    <br /><b> And what are the career prospects in different fields?</b>
                    <br /><br/> Self-introspection is the key to unlock the box of your queries!  As you are aware, you can opt for 
                    either Science, Commerce or Arts stream after 10th standard. Before choosing a stream, you should conduct an in-depth 
                    analysis of your strengths and weaknesses and then select a stream that aligns with your interests and professional goals.
                    While the Commerce and Arts stream subjects have their own advantages, methodologies, and career prospects, we, in this blog,
                    will shed light on various Science stream subjects. But before that, let us try to understand the reasons for choosing this 
                    stream. 

                    While these notions hardly hold a candle to reality, chances are you would have some type of understanding about what the science
                    stream entails.

                    The Science stream, as I mentioned above, relates to the study of the physical and natural world through the study
                    of pure sciences and their applications in the real world. From understanding how the laws of gravitation govern
                    planetary motion to learning about the structure of the atom, you will uncover the many mysteries of the world around
                    us.

                    Thus, innate curiosity and keenness to explore, coupled with a logical thinking ability are essential to be successful
                    in this stream.

                <p className="school_container2_subheading">2. Science Stream Subjects after Class 10th :</p> 
                <p>The science stream is further divided into 2 branches, namely medical (PCB) and non-medical (PCM) science stream.
                <br /> 
                The difference between the two lies in the choice of the third subject. While Physics and Chemistry are compulsory for both, the medical stream offers Biology as the 3rd compulsory subject, and the non-medical stream offers Mathematics. English is common to all streams and students can take up any optional subject to meet a total of 5 subjects.

                Here is a detailed look into the compulsory subjects in the Science stream:

                <p>
                    Physics is among the oldest academic fields in the world and is the science of matter, motion, energy, and force.
                    It focuses on understanding how the universe behaves. Advances in the field of physics enable advancements in
                    technologies, such as the study of electromagnetism, thermodynamics, mechanics, nuclear physics and solid-state physics.

                    Studying physics at Class 11-12 level will help you develop observational, analytical, investigatory and decision
                    making skills, along with conceptual understanding, creative thinking, and problem-solving skills.

                <p>
                    Everything in the universe is made out of atoms and matter, and the study of Chemistry is based on the study of the composition,
                    properties, and structure of matter, including atomic structure and the changes influenced by chemical reactions.

                    New areas in chemistry, such as synthetic materials, natural resources, biomolecules, and industrial chemistry are also 
                    included in the course at the Class 11-12 level, ensuring that you get a thorough understanding of Chemistry fundamentals and

                    III. Biology :
                </p>

                <p>
                   The term ‘Biology’ is derived from the Greek language, with ‘bios’ meaning life and ‘logos’ meaning study, 
                   literally translating into the study of life forms. And that’s exactly what biology is. Biology studies living organisms – 
                   plants and animals – including facets such as their physical structures, physiological mechanisms, chemical processes, 
                   molecular interactions, and development and evolution.

                   The subject of Biology at the Class 11-12 level focuses on providing a firm conceptual basis while also connecting 
                   the study of the subject with real-life technology, environment, agriculture, health, and industry.
                    <br />

                <p>
                    Mathematics is a science of numbers and is often the most hated subject for students, and sometimes the most loved with 
                    use in money transactions and applications even in architecture, art, engineering, and sports. As a subject, 
                    Math focuses on the concepts of quantity, change, structure, and space.

                    At a Class 11-12 level, you would learn about the principles of underlying processes and skills, 
                    identify the flow of reason while solving a problem or proving a result, and learn how to apply acquired skills to solve 
                    problems by more than one method. If you pursue the Medical (PCB) stream, you can also take on Mathematics as an optional 
                    subject.

                    Commerce
                </section>
                <p>
                    Commerce is defined as the exchange of goods and services among individuals and business entities.
                    In academics, Commerce is considered to be one of the most popular streams of education along with Science and Arts.
                    Commerce deals with the various aspects of business, trade, accounting, financial information/transactions and merchandising.
                    Commerce plays a significant role in the development of nations and its citizens by facilitating trade between nations or within
                    the nation.

                    The next in line, Commerce is not without its own associated myths. The most popular ones being,
                    “Commerce is good for average students who cannot get into science” or “Commerce is only suitable for students from
                    business families.”

                    These are again a far cry from the truth. Commerce is a field that relates to the study of business, trade and finance.
                    Commerce students study how goods and services are exchanged, how businesses operate, how financial transactions occur,
                    how the economy of the country works, and more. The indispensability of commerce and its related careers to our day-to-day
                    living makes it a lucrative field to explore, and one with a wide choice of career options too.

                    While you may or may not choose to study Mathematics as part of Commerce, numbers form the base for this stream.
                    A strong hold over calculations and fundamentals of maths, and the ability to deal with large amounts of data are
                    critical elements of success in the commerce stream.
